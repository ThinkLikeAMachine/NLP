##Project Summary
Data of new protein beverage products launched between 2020-2023 were collected from a commercial products database. The texts of 'product claims/description' were processed and the main topics were extracted. The main topics of each new 'product claims/description' provide us further understanding of which consumer group the product is targeting. For example, for new protein beverage products launched globally, there are 3 major targeting consumers groups: 1) Consumers who care most about the nutrition; 2) Consumers who care most about certified ingredients; 3) Consumers who care most about increased performance during workout and muscle building.

###Problem Statement
The information of targeted consumer groups is implicitly embedded in the 'product claims & descriptions'. It is nearly impossible for humans to read through tens of thousands of product descriptions and extract the “hidden” topics. The insights of targeting consumer groups of the new products can provide guidance for product developers on the new product development.
